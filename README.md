# ScrabbleGame
This program resembles the scrabble game. It's a multi-threaded TCP server in Java, with synchronization, challenge-response authentication using RSA and a using session key for efficient communication after initial authentication. The server will let users query what score a given word is worth in the game of scrabble. Each user will be able to post a word. The server will remember the most recent word posted by each user and will be able to report all the usersâ€™ most recent words, sorted by their scrabble score. A word can consist of up to 24 letters. Either capital or lower-case is fine, but a word can only contain letters (no spaces, punctuation, digits, etc).
